    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // VALUES are copied (not references)
    // changing original does not update other one 
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Dip';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Dippy';
    console.log(name, name2);



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team1 = players;

    console.log(players, team1);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team1[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team1);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // REFERENCES are copied (not values)
    // changing original updates the other one 

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // slice does not change the original array
    // returns a slice of the array (from starting index inclusive to ending // // index exclusive)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // spread will take every item out of iterable and put it into the containing thing (array)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'reeeee';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // using Array.from(array)
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'cool';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain1 = person;
    captain1.age = 99;

    console.log(person, captain1);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // use Object.assign()
    // start with blank object, pass it the object you wish to copy
    // properties from, then fold in new properties to overwrite
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 100, number: 12 });

    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // not confirmed yet!!
    // const captain3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    // wes unchanged
    console.table(wes);
    console.table(dev);

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    // wes changed
    console.table(wes);
    console.table(dev);

    // poor man's cloneDeep
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.facebook = 'different';
    // wes unchanged
    console.table(wes);
    console.table(dev2);
